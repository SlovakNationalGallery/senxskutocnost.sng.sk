<span class="drop-cap">T</span> <br>he Slovak National Council was created at the end of 1943 by the representatives of the illegal Communist Party and the representatives of civil resistance surrounding Jozef Lettrich and Ján Ursíny. These two groups issued the "Christmas Agreement", which set out a plan for an armed uprising and toppling of the dictatorship of the HSPP.

At the appropriate time, the Slovak National Council was supposed to assume control over Slovakia and, after free elections, transfer the power to the elected representatives. The Slovak National Council envisioned the relationship of Czechs and Slovaks in Czechoslovakia on the basis of equality between the two nations.
